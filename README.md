## TUTLEBOT3 using simple MPC without constrains

In this repository you can see a single MPC controller without constraints using ros2 and C++ implementing Maciejowski strategy. The main idea is to use 

MPC with gazebo software simulator.In the next code section, is the algorithm for the simple control Strategy.

## Future Work 
constraints and MIMO controller will be add.
